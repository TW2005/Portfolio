# Engineering Portfolio

This repository collects selected projects completed during my Mechanical & Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Bath. It centralises design files, code, documentation, and analysis that demonstrate practical engineering ability across embedded systems, digital electronics, control, power, and mechanical design.

## 📁 Project Index

- **FPGA Development (Cyclone V / HDL)**  
  HDL modules, testbenches, finite-state machines, and timing-driven design.

### UAV & Robotics
- **Bath Drone Team – Avionics (5 kg Fixed-Wing UAV)**  
  Wiring diagrams, telemetry integration, ESC/UBEC power distribution, servo mapping, and component selection.

- **Radar / ML / FPGA Concept Project**  
  Early-stage research on low-latency ML classification pipelines.

### Mechanical & Electrical Engineering Coursework
- **Thermofluids Labs**
- **Solid Mechanics Analysis**
- **Circuit Theory & Digital Electronics**
- **MATLAB Simulation Work**

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated
- Embedded C / Arduino development  
- Digital logic design (HDL)  
- MATLAB data analysis  
- PCB and wiring design  
- Control system integration  
- Power electronics fundamentals  
- UAV avionics and system architecture  
- Version control & documentation

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository will grow over time. Each major project will be added as its own folder containing:
- Source code  
- Schematics or wiring diagrams  
- CAD or mechanical drawings  
- Reports, notes, and design documentation  

## 📝 Notes
This portfolio is an ongoing work-in-progress as I migrate existing university and personal projects into version-controlled format.
